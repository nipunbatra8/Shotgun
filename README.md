# Shotgun

Hello everyone, we are Team Absolute Value Alpha from Arcadia, CA and our product is the application “shotgun.” This application aims to optimize vacations and travelling by decommodifying ride sharing, improving trip planning, and finding activities to do at a user’s destination.

With a user-friendly and aesthetic interface, the user can comfortably navigate through the log in and sign up screens. The user can sign up with their email and password. They are then added to the Firebase Database we have created and then are able to login. The user may also login or signup with Google.

The app will then take the user to their profile. From there, they can navigate to the other sections of the app to access the functions.

In the “Host a Ride” section, the user can fill out a form that allows them to offer rides to other users. They will start by entering in their Destination, Vehicle, Number of seats available, and departure date. Then, the application will bring up other users who have requested rides to the same destination. 

If the user wishes to request a ride, they may move to the “Find a Ride” section. They can enter their desired destination, number of seats needed, and the date which they must arrive by. Then, the app will match them with other users offering rides to the destination.
To plan out trips, the user can utilize shotgun’s built in “Trip Calculator.” They can enter in their location and final destination, along with a final date they desire to arrive by. The app will then utilize Google Maps to estimate the length of the trip. Based on weather and the length of the trip, the app can also provide recommendations on how many restroom breaks, water breaks, and meals the user should plan into their schedule.

In the “Explore” section, the user can find activities to do once they arrive at their destination. The user inputs their location along with their interests. Then, the application will utilize data from the Google Calendar Events API along with Google Maps to find upcoming events or locations that the user may be interested in.

Finally, the user may adjust their preferences in the “Settings” section, including Appearance, Notifications, and Visual Aid. They may also use the help option if they need assistance.

Here are all the members of the team and this concludes our presentation. We want to thank all the organizers and judges who allowed this event to be possible.
